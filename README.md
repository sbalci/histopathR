I plan to collect codes for future research. I will add some small functions.
I plan two tutorial files as vignettes:
- How to prepare data for histopathological research
- How to analyse data for histopathological research


- Methods to import and prepare data for analysis.
- Descriptive statistics.
- Hypothesis tests.
- Survival analysis.
- Regression analysis.
- Cluster analysis.
