**I plan to collect codes for future research. I will add some small functions.**
- Methods to import and prepare data for analysis.
- Descriptive statistics.
- Hypothesis tests.
- Survival analysis.
- Regression analysis.
- Cluster analysis.



**I plan to make template files to form when loading the package.**


**I plan two tutorial files as vignettes:**
